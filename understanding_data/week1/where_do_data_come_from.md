# Where Do Data Come From?
## Different Type of Data
### Two key types of data
- Organic / Process Data
    - generateld by process 
- "Designed" Data Collection


### Organic / Process Data 
- Data generated by Process 
#### Examples 
- Ex: Financial or Point of Sale Transactions 
- Ex: Stock market exchanges 
- Nextflix viewing history 
- web browser activity 
- sports event
    - outcome of the event results 
- tempreture/pollution sensors 

There `process` generate massive quantities of data

Processing requires significant computationl resources; 
`data scientists "mine"` these data to study trends and `uncover interesting relationships`.

### Designed Data Collection
Designed to specifically address a stated research objective.
- Individuals `sampled from a population`, interviewd about opinions on a particular topic.
- forcus on a subset of something 

#### Common Features of "Designed" Data
- Sampling from populations
- administration of carefully desgined questions 
- typically data sets are much smaller compared to organic/process data sets
    - which means less const for computational perspective
- data collected for very specific reasons, rather than simple reflections of ongoing natural process
### I.I.D
🖊️ I = Independent 
🖊️ ID = Identically Distributed 

> for analyzing data, regardless of source, an important question:
>Q: can the data be considered i.i.d?

### i.i.d data 
***Example***: Final example scores 
from a large Intro to States class at a university are `Independent Observations` from `common normal distribution`
- each student are treated independently 

> In i.i.d, we cam estimate 

### What if Data are NOT in i.i.d
***Example***
- students sitting next to each other tends to have similar score
    - breaking `independency`
- males and females might have different means
    - i.e. having different distributions
        - breaking `identically distributed`
- students from same discussion section may have similar scores 

> Dependencies and differences need to be accounted for in analysis!
> -> Need different analytic procedures
